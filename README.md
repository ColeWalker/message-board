# Message board back-end

This is an incomplete application that I built on [stream](https://twitch.tv/supcole) to better learn how authentication works. The front-end portion can be found on my [other message board repository.](https://github.com/ColeWalker/message-board-front-end) This application was built using Express, MongoDB, and Passport.
